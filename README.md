# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using neural networks, specifically developed with Python and utilizing the NumPy library. The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning while achieving accurate digit classification.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
1. Run the `digit_recognition.py` script.
2. The script will load the training and test datasets, preprocess the data, train the neural network model, and perform predictions on a sample of handwritten digits.

## Neural Network Architecture
The neural network architecture consists of two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a softmax activation function in the output layer. The model is trained using gradient descent with backpropagation.

## Example
To see the model in action, run the provided script. It will display predictions for a sample of handwritten digits.

## Google Colab
For a hands-on experience with the project, you can access a Google Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sdq5znrqaseeNXUHenpXiBKj1wCzmneK#scrollTo=vNoqcZAHF0-q).
